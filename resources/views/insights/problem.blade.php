						<!-- Info -->
						<p class="mt-2">Digital literacy is the most basic and most crucial thing in the face of current technological developments.  Based on  a survey organized by the Ministry of Communication and Informatics (Kemkominfo) and the Katadata Insight Center (KIC) in  2021, Indonesia's digital literacy index is at 3.49.  This figure puts Indonesia in the moderate category.  In the face of the rapid development of technology, digital literacy is the key and the main foundation that must be owned.
                            However, one of the problems faced by Indonesia is that there is still a gap in access to information through digital technology, especially for people who live on the poverty line, live in rural areas, elderly people, and people with disabilities. The APJII survey in 2017 described the internet penetration rate in urban and rural areas at 72.41% vs. 48.25%. While the majority of users are in the age range of 15 â€“ 19 years, and only 16.2% are over 60 years old.
                            Another challenge is that based on data from Japelidi in 2018, the majority of digital literacy education is still carried out at the tertiary level. Even though the majority of active internet users are not only in universities. Data from the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education states that the total number of students in Indonesia is only 6.9 million people or 5% of all internet users.
                            For those who have not used the internet, the biggest obstacle is based on data from the Ministry of Communication and Informatics in 2018 as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Don't know how to use technology


                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Not interested or do not feel the need to use because it does not see the function of the internet
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The high cost
                                </li>

                            </ul>



                            This unbalanced opportunity is often referred to as the digital divide. The digital divide itself is defined as the gap between individuals, households, businesses, and geographical areas at different socio-economic levels related to their opportunities in accessing ICT and its use for various activities (Gargallo-Castel, et.al., 2010).
